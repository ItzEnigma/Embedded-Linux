## Customizing

Customization allows you to add new packages, modify existing packages, and create new images. The customization process involves creating a new layer, adding a new recipe to the layer, and building the recipe. **The recipe is a set of instructions that tells the build system how to build the package**.

---

## Recipe

### Recipe Name

Recipe filenames follow the convention **`<packagename>_<version>-<revision>.bb`** ... The fields **packagename**, **version**, and **revision** of the recipe filename are
assigned by BitBake to the variables **`PN`**, **`PV`**, and **`PR`**, respectively.

> :exclamation: **Do not use the `underscore` anywhere else in the recipe name** ... The use of `hyphens` is allowed for the package name as well as for the package version but should be avoided for the latter.

**Example:** `avahi_0.6.31.bb`

A particular issue for the recipe filename arises when the package is fetched from a
branch of a **software configuration management** _(SCM)_ system **and the version is not associated with a tag.** ... In this case, recipes should be named **`<packagename>_<scm>.bb`**, where _scm_ is the name of the versioning system, such as **git**, **svn**, or **cvs**. The recipe should then set **`PV`** explicitly to **`PV = "<version>+git${SRCREV}"`** ... **`SRCREV` points to the revision to fetch from the SCM**

> :exclamation: Using incorrect recipe names could result in trouble with the package managers creating, installing, and maintaining package versions for the target root filesystems

## `Bitbake` create a layer & package

First, make sure you run the **source environment script** to set up the environment variables for the build system. _`(oe-init-build-env)`_. Then to create a package, you need to **create a recipe** for the **package** you are interested in. And you can **create a new layer** with a basic structure using the following command:

### Create a `meta layer`

```bash
# Create a new layer with a basic structure (conf/ recipes/ README)
bitbake-layers create-layer meta-enigma
```

> :grey_exclamation: You can change layer & recipe name to whatever you want!

---

### Create a `recipe`

**A basic recipe:**

1. Create a recipe directory in the **`meta-enigma/`** directory --> **`recipes-enigma/`**
2. Create a recipe file in the **`recipes-enigma/`** directory --> **`enigma_0.1.bb`**
3. Create a **`files`** directory in the **`enigma_0.1/`** directory --> **`files/`** ... then add your source code file to it
4. Edit the **`enigma_0.1.bb`** recipe file to include the following:
   > :exclamation: This is a simple example of a recipe that compiles a C program and installs the resulting binary into the target’s **`/usr/bin`** directory

```bash
SUMMARY = "bitbake-layers enigma recipe"
DESCRIPTION = "ItzEnigma Recipe"
LICENSE = "MIT"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://${COREBASE}/meta/COPYING.MIT;md5=3da9cfbcb788c80a0384361b4de20420"

SRC_URI = "file://enigma.c"
S = "${WORKDIR}"

do_compile (){
  ${CC} ${LDFLAGS} enigma.c -o ${S}/enigma
}

do_install (){
  install -d ${D}${bindir}
  install -m 0755 enigma ${D}${bindir}/
}

python do_display_banner() {
    bb.plain("***********************************************");
    bb.plain("*                                             *");
    bb.plain("*  ItzEnigma !!!   *");
    bb.plain("*                                             *");
    bb.plain("***********************************************");
}

addtask display_banner before do_build
```

### Add the recipe to the layer

Add the **`meta-layer`** to the **`BBLAYERS`** variable in the **`conf/bblayers.conf`** file. Then you can build and use the recipe.

**There are two ways:**

- Using **`bitbake-layers add-layer mylayer`** command
- Manually adding the layer to the **`BBLAYERS`** variable in the **`conf/bblayers.conf`** file.

> :grey_exclamation: If the meta-layer is already added to your build, then no need to add it again.

---

### Build the recipe

You can build this specific recipe using the following command:

```bash
bitbake [your_recipe_name]
# Example --> bitbake enigma

# To clean the recipe
bitbake -c clean enigma
```

> :grey_exclamation: If you add the recipe to your image **`local.conf`** file (`IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " enigma"`), the recipe will be **built** and **installed** into the image when you build the image.
>
> :exclamation: **`bitbake`** will **automatically** run the **`do_compile()`** and **`do_install()`** ... if you have rm_work enabled, you might not be able to see the output binary file in the **`tmp/work`** directory.

---

- **`bindir`** represent a configuration variable that added in bitbake which represent that the binary will be installed in `/usr/bin`
- **`sbindir`** represent that the binaries will be installed in `/usr/sbin`

> :grey_exclamation: The output would be at `/path/to/poky/build/tmp/work/armv7vet2hf-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi/enigma/0.1-r0/image` ... if the **output image** is not being shown in the **`tmp/work`** directory, then you can **disable** the **`rm_work`** option in the **`local.conf`** file. **AND MAKE SURE TO `cleanall`** ... `bitbake -e [recipe_name] -c cleanall`

---

## Create a new image

```bash
bitbake-layers create-layer meta-live

vim conf/bblayers.conf # Add newly created layer into BBLAYERS

# Copy the a reference image recipe to your new image layer to be modified and used as your image recipe.
cp /path/to/poky/meta/recipes-core/images/core-image-minimal-dev.bb  /path/to/poky/meta-live/recipes-example/images/example-image.bb

# Customize the image recipe
vim example-image.bb

# Make sure to add require the reference image recipe that you're using ... at the first line !!!
require recipes-core/images/core-image-minimal.bb

# You're ready to build the image
bitbake example-image
```

---

## `devtool`

Devtool is a suite of tools that assist you in developing and debugging your application or image recipes. It can be used to **add new recipes**, **edit existing recipes**, **create new layers**, and **create new images** ...
`devtool –help`

> :exclamation: Before you can use devtool for your development, **you need to source a build environment, as usual**.

### Generate/Add new recipe

Generate new recipe at build/workspace/recipes/this-is/this-is_git.bb ... the recipe will be using a git repository to fetch the source code.

```bash
devtool add https://github.com/LetoThe2nd/this_is.git

# Check/edit the recipe
devtool edit-recipe this-is

# Add the recipe to the image
# You can use local.conf or the image recipe to add the new recipe.
vim conf/local.conf     # Add IMAGE_INSTALL += "this-is"

# OR
vim example-image.bb    # Do update of IMAGE_INSTALL += "this-is"

# Build the image
bitbake example-image
```

---

### Deploy the recipe

Deploy the recipe to the target ... The target is the address of the target machine, w**hich must be running an SSH server** _(i.e. user@hostname[:destdir])_.

```bash
# Deploy the recipe to the target
devtool deploy-target recipe target
# Example: devtool deploy-target this-is root@192.168.2.77

# Make sure to set up the SSH & ip address of the target machine (RPI4 for example)
```
