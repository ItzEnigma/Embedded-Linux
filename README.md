# Embedded-Linux

**"Embedded Linux is not rocket science anymore"**

This is a collection of notes and resources for Embedded Linux development ... the repository is a work in progress and will be updated regularly, and it's divided into the following sections:

- [Tasks (Admin Linux/Embedded Linux)](Tasks/)
- [Notebooks](Notebooks/)
- [C++ Workspace](C++-workspace/)
- [Makefile](Notebooks/Makefile)

**Tasks** contains the tasks for linux and embedded linux, **Notebooks** contains the notes for **linux**, **embedded linux**, **C++**, **Makefile** and **IoT**, **C++ Workspace** contains the C++ programming notes, tasks and solved problems and **IoT** contains the notes and resources for Internet of Things.
